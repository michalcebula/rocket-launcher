# Launcher App

One thing it does right now is it creates rocket launches...but not really.

## This is where we need your help

As of now, the Launches are not actually stored anywhere after a successful 'creation'.
Let's change that. Make sure to save valid launches to the database before returning a response from our API.  

### But there's more!

It's not only about *WHAT*, we also care about *HOW*. A lot.

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:
- add more robust tests,
- remember about the [Boy Scout rule](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html),
- make sure the code you check in is SOLID,
- make sure your commit history represents your approach to coding and tells us the story,
- optimize as you wish,
- other than persisting the data, don't change any of the existing business logic.


Good luck!
